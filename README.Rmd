## Background

The increasing digitization of research data has motivated data standardization efforts across scientific disciplines. The vegetation science community has 
recognized the need for a standardized exchange format since at least 2003 and developed the initial version of the Veg-X standard in 2008 (Wiser et al., 2011). 
Veg-X is implemented as an XML schema that provides both flexibility and precision in representing vegetation data of different origin and format.

Veg-X has not found wide adoption among vegetation ecologists to this date. One of the reasons for this was the lack of tools to easily create 
Veg-X documents. A major step towards improving the usability of Veg-X was the publication of the VegX R-package (De Cáceres, 2018),
which provides tools for importing, integrating and exporting vegetation data using the Veg-X standard. While the VegX package allows users to 
create Veg-X documents using R programming language, interest in a GUI-based application for Veg-X remained high.

**VegXshiny aims to make the conversion of vegetation data into Veg-X documents as easy as possible.** The graphical user interface of VegXshiny helps users, who have 
no experience with programming or markup languages (XML in this case), to build valid Veg-X documents and implement best practices in terms of data management and 
interoperability. Dynamic import dialogs guide users through the process of mapping their data to the corresponding Veg-X elements, while ensuring that the generated 
XML conforms to the Veg-X standard. The ability to view and edit input files and output VegX documents gives users full control over their data. Finally, an interactive 
tree viewer of the Veg-X schema helps making the standard accessible and understandable.

The development of VegXshiny is endorsed by the [International Association for Vegetation Science (IAVS)](http://iavs.org/).
